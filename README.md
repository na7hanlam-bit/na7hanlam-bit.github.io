# na7hanlam-bit.github.io

Personal GitHub Pages site for Nathan. This repository contains a minimal static site (root `index.html`) derived from `design.md`.

What you'll find
- `index.html` — the site's main page
- `css/styles.css` — basic styling
- `design.md` — original design notes and content

Quick preview (from repository root):

```powershell
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Deploying
- GitHub Pages: set the repository to publish from the `main` branch (root). The site will be available at `https://na7hanlam-bit.github.io`.

Next steps
- Add images, social links, or extra pages (Projects, Contact).
- Optionally migrate to a static site generator (Jekyll, Hugo) for templates and easier content management.
